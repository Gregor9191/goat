Screenshots
===========

GOAT offers a simple feature of taking screenshots. The default key binding is
``P``. Screenshots are stored in user's local directory (``user://``), in a
subdirectory called ``Screenshots``. The subdirectory's name can easily be
changed:

   goat.SCREENSHOT_DIRECTORY = "Your Custom Screenshot Directory"
